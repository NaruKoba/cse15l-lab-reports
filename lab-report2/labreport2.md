## The command with no arguments

![Image](noarg.png)

For the first command: cd, my working directory was ~/lecture1/messages, messages directory. Cd command changes a working directory to the directory given as an argument to the cd command. I didn't put any argument for cd command, so no argument behaved like home directory and my working directory was changed to home directory. Therefore, the output indicates this is not an error.
