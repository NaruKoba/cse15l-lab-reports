#### StudentA:

I'm working on a project where I have a Java program that processes data from a file and then outputs results. There's also a Bash script that sets up the environment, compiles the Java code, and runs it with specific parameters. However, I'm encountering some odd behavior:

1. The Java program doesn't seem to process the file data correctly.
2. The final output of the Bash script is not displaying the expected results.

I'm attaching a screenshot of the terminal output after running the Bash script.
Any suggestions on what might be going wrong?
