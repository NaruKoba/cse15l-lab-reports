#### StudentA:
I'm working on a project where I have a Java program that processes data from a file and then outputs results. There's also a Bash script that sets up the environment, compiles the Java code, and runs it with specific parameters. However, I'm encountering some odd behavior:

The Java program doesn't seem to process the file data correctly.

I'm attaching a screenshot of the terminal output after running the Bash script.
Any suggestions on what might be going wrong?

#### TA:
To address the first issue, could you insert a print statement in your Java code to show the file's contents that it's reading? This will help us verify if the file reading part is working correctly.
